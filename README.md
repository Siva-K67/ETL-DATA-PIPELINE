• Engineered an automated ETL pipeline to ingest, validate, and store multi-sensor compost data (temperature, humidity, NH3, H2S, CH4) from raw CSV inputs.
• Designed modular extract–transform–load scripts to handle missing values, detect outliers, and maintain data consistency across multiple datasets.
• Automated periodic execution of the pipeline and loaded cleaned data into a structured SQL database for scalable analysis and monitoring.
• Visualized time-series trends and gas concentration variations to verify data quality and pipeline performance using Matplotlib
